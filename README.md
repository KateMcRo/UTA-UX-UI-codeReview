# UX/UI Coding Review

This repository contains supplemental files aimed at helping fill common knowledge gaps and reinforcing the concepts from the coding portion of this course. These files are intended to be used alongside live demonstrations where I'll be walking you through various topics.

## Topics

1. HTML Structure: Explore examples of well-structured HTML documents to understand the fundamentals of building the backbone of web pages. 

2. CSS Styling: Dive into CSS files to learn about styling techniques, selectors, and best practices for making your designs visually appealing.

3. Flex vs. Grids: Understand the differences between flexbox and CSS grid layout systems and when to use each for optimal design control.
